This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the Laravel application, including seeding the database.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (version 8.0 or higher)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or any other database supported by Laravel
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm/yarn

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Configure the Environment

- Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Update the `.env` file with your database and application configuration:
  - **DB_CONNECTION**: `mysql` (or your database driver)
  - **DB_HOST**: `127.0.0.1`
  - **DB_PORT**: `3306`
  - **DB_DATABASE**: Your database name
  - **DB_USERNAME**: Your database username
  - **DB_PASSWORD**: Your database password

### 4. Generate the Application Key

Run the following command to generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the migrations to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Seed the Database

To populate the database with sample data, run the seeder:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

By default, the application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Additional Commands

### Clear Cache (Optional)

If you encounter caching issues, run the following commands:

```bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### Run Tests

To run the application's tests, use:

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: Database connection failed**
  - Ensure your `.env` file contains the correct database credentials.
  - Check if your database server is running.

- **Error: Missing `.env` file**
  - Make sure to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure it correctly.
